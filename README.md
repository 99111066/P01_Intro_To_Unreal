# P01_Intro_To_Unreal
This is a physics based Roll-A-Ball game which consists of 3 levels. In this project I learned: 
- Physics based control/movement
- Blueprint Scripting
- Particle System Creation (both in Niagara and Cascade)
- Splines for level creation
- Widgets for HUD and Title screen
- Material creation and Material Instancing
